// Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

// For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

// Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.


public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value

        int ones = 0;
        while (n != 0) {                //!= 0, instead of > 0 !!! may be negative number
            ones += (n & 1);
            n >>>= 1;
        }
